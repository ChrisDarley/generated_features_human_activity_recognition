The data used for this notebook is a set of engineered features generated for each 128 timestep portion of activity.
Using linear discriminant analysis, accuracy greater than 96% can be achieved when predicting the activity being performed.

This notebook and the accuracy achieved is meant to be a benchmark of success for the cnn based model found here:
